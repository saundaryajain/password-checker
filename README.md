#password-checker
This project lets us check whether your password is safe to use or not i.e. it checks if it has ever been compromised in a data breach.

It uses the https://haveibeenpwned.com/ API to let us input our passwords from a text file rather than inputting the password on a website as it makes our passwords vulnerable to any breach.

The project outputs the result in a text file and tells how many times the password has been hacked or if it is safe to use.
